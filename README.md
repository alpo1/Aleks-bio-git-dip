# Polikarpov Aleksandr



On the morning of March 21, 1991, a strong little boy named Aleksander was born, who was destined to sit and write this coursework.
But speaking seriously, I am a person who loves to solve complex tasks, enjoys when work does not turn into routine, and when you see the result of your work, rather than just working for the sake of it.

- High work capacity
- Fast-paced
- Responsibility for the result.
